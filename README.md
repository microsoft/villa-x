This is the official repository for [villa-X: Enhancing Latent Action Modeling
in Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23682).


## 📖 Overview
![villa-x](assets/overview.png)
* We improve latent action learning by introducing an extra proprio FDM, which aligns latent tokens with underlying robot states and actions and grounds them in physical dynamics.

* We propose to jointly learn a latent action expert and a robot action expert through joint diffusion in the policy model, conditioning robot action prediction on latent actions to fully exploit their potential.

* Our method demonstrates superior performance on simulated environments as well as on real-world robotic tasks. The latent action expert can effectively plan into future with both visual and proprio state planning. 

## 🔥 News

* 2025/08/01: Initial release of the paper, project website, pre-trained Latent Action Model (LAM), and LAM inference code.

## 🔧 Setup

1. Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/villa-x.git
cd villa-x
```

2. Install the required packages.

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential zlib1g-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev liblzma-dev libncurses-dev tk-dev python3-dev ffmpeg -y
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh # Skip this step if you already have uv installed
uv sync
```


## ➡️ Getting Started

### Inference with Pre-trained Latent Action Model

1. Download the pre-trained models from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/villa-x).

2. Load the latent action model.

```python
from lam import IgorModel

lam = IgorModel.from_pretrained("LOCAL_MODEL_DIRECTORY").cuda()
```

3. Extract the latent actions from a video.

```bash
def read_video(fp: str):
    from torchvision.io import read_video

    video, *_ = read_video(fp, pts_unit="sec")
    return video

video = read_video("path/to/video.mp4").cuda()  # Load your video here
latent_action = lam.idm(video)
```

4. Use image FDM to reconstruct future frames from the latent actions.

```python
frames = []
for i in range(len(latent_action[0])):
    pred = lam.apply_latent_action(video[i], latent_action[0][i])
    frames.append(pred)
```

We also provide a Jupyter [notebook](demo/notebook.ipynb) for a step-by-step guide on how to use the pre-trained latent action model.
